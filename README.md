"9*9 in less than 30 seconds": An automated Sudoku Solver

Built a sudoku solver, which , when given an sudoku puzzle image as input, extracts the digits and blanks from the puzzle and gives back the solved puzzle.

Computer vision techniques were deployed to effectively capture the grid and cell boundaries of the puzzle, and a CNN model was added to the pipeline to extract the digits.

Both backtracking techniques/ as well as attempts to solve the sudoku using neural networks were done and the consolidated model was able to fetch and solve hard puzzles effectively.
